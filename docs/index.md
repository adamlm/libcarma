# CARMA Library

The CARMA Library (`libcarma`) lifts code from various CARMA repositories into
generic and reusable components. Free from time and budget constraints, this
opinionated library updates the original libraries to use the latest
software architecture and implementation best practices.

Finally, `libcarma` serves as an experimental sandbox for design improvements
and new libraries that might make their way back to the official CARMA
repositories.
